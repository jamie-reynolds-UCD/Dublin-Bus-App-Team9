# Dublin-Bus-App-Team9

*This project involves analysing historic Dublin Bus data and weather data in order to create dynamic travel time estimates. Based on data analysis of historic Dublin Bus data, a system which when presented with any bus route, departure time, the day of the week, current weather condition, produces an accurate estimate of travel time for the complete route and sections of the route.*
